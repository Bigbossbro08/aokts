Sort conditions and effects
---------------------------

This menu button sorts all conditions and effects within each and every
trigger alphanumerically based on their trigger hint. This means that
effects are organised with similar effects grouped together. The one
exception is that "Create unit" effects always come before "Change
ownership" effects. This is to make sure that this common design pattern
still works where you create a unit then change it to GAIA to make a
non-converting GAIA unit.

Add Activation
--------------

This button button allows you to automagically create "Activate Trigger"
effects for a range of triggers and place them in the destination
trigger of your choice.
