The method is changing your Town Center's ownership to GAIA and then back again. This will cancel the research everytime and refund the resources.

Create a new Looping Trigger, and add the following:

Trigger 1
C: Researching Tech: Feudal Age (or w.e age)
E: Change Ownership: Player 1 to GAIA - Town Center (Do not set an actual object, this will change all TC's to GAIA briefly)
E: Send Chat: Player 1: "You cannot advance yet!"
E: Activate Trigger 2

Trigger 2
E: Change Ownership: GAIA to Player 1 - Town Center
