In order to advance to the next age, besides the tech cost, it also requires an amount of buildings created from the current age

when one of those buildings is created, it initializates one research (Shadow X), and there is one research that check if at least 2 (except for imperial age) of those buildings were built (Shadow Node for Age X). that research, the previous age and the food/gold cost are the requirements to advance to the next age

so all you need to disable the next age button is to disable one of these researches (use trigger studio):

120 - Shadow Node for Age Two
135 - Shadow Node for Age Three
142 - Shadow Node for Age Four

edit:

if instead you want to re-enable the button later, disable these techs (dont disable the Shadow Node for Age X):

- for feudal age
108 - Dock built
110 - Mill built
122 - Barracks built
258 - Lumber Camp built
282 - Mining Camp built

- for castle age
106 - Blacksmith built
128 - Market Built
130 - Stable built
132 - Archery Range built

- for imperial age
107 - Monastery built
138 - Siege Workshop built
146 - University built
266 - Castle built

and then manually research 'Shadow Node for Age X' via triggers
