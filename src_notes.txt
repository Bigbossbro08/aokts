AOKTS Source Notes

--Building--
The source code compiles with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. Four configurations
are built-in: AOK Release, AOK Debug, SWGB Release, SWGB Debug. They should be
self-explanatory. :)

--New CVS Changelog--
Sadly, this is in descending date order. Maybe I'll fix that some day.

		more robust and easier to fix in the future.

	* trigedit.cpp 1.46:
	* utilui.cpp 1.15:
	* utilui.h 1.22:

	* scx_format.txt 1.18:
		Updated for discovery of "Display Time" attribute of effects a 
		while ago. Oops.

2007-03-10	David
	* editors.cpp 1.47:
		Cleaned up IM editor a little bit, and resetting the editor no 
		longer creates a contradictory state. (bug 116)

	* ecedit.cpp 1.45:
		AOKTS didn't update the working effect type until the the OK 
		button was clicked, resulting in the wrong unit selection dialog

		Updated the makefile to be a little more logical and added game-
		specific resource files to allow for different icons and even 
		different dialogs if that becomes necessary.

2006-12-18	David
	* scen.cpp 1.61:
	* scen.h 1.31:
		Renamed Scenario::AOKBMP::export() to toFile() to avoid using a 
		reserved word in some compilers.

	* datatypes.h 1.14:
		Fixed some old stuff which I really should have fixed a while 
		ago. Also subsituted the STL <new> header for the old <new.h>. I 
		don't really like the STL but at least my compiler will stop 
		complaining. :-P

	* utilio.h 1.8:
		Switched from Microsoft-specific ASSERT stuff to the CRT assert()
		 stuff.

	* aokts.cpp 1.56:
		Some changes for compatability with non-MS compilers.

	* utilui.h 1.20:
		Changed some debug switches to not rely on undocumented defines (
		that is, ones that may change per build environment).

	* editors.h 1.13:
	* esdata.h 1.11:
		Added a newline at the end of the file...

2006-12-14	David
	* AOK Trigger Studio.dsp 1.16:
		Removed data.xml in favor of two files, data_aok.xml and 
		data_swgb.xml. To facilitate this, I added a path parameter to 
		ESDATA::load().

	* mapview.cpp 1.19:
		2 bugs: the map click notification had wrong x and y parameters (
		bug 110) and the highlighting when resetting map was painted in 
		the wrong place (offset applied twice).

	* esdata.cpp 1.11:
		Changed "ref" attribute to "color" in the XML files and added a 
		bunch of SWGB data to data_swgb.xml.

	* scen.cpp 1.60:
	* scen.h 1.30:
		Some changes for expansion detection in SWGB.

	* editors.cpp 1.44:
		Added an "all" boolean paramater to LoadMap() so that changing 
		the selected tile doesn't load everything. Also added a report 
		to the logfile when an unknown ai type is encountered.

2006-12-13	David
	* utilui.h 1.19:
		Fixed a possible crash in LB_getid().

		Fixed a possible crash if unit type could not be found.

	* aokts.cpp 1.54:
	* data.xml 1.9:
	* esdata.cpp 1.10:
	* esdata.h 1.10:
		Removed data.xml in favor of two files, data_aok.xml and 
		data_swgb.xml. To facilitate this, I added a path parameter to 
		ESDATA::load().

	* scen.cpp 1.59:
		The default constructor for unit now sets the type as the first 
		in the list, not automatically null. This should avoid some 
		errors (not crashes) in the unit viewer when dealing with a 
		scenario with 0 units.

2006-12-08	David
	* ecedit.cpp 1.41:
	* scx_format.txt 1.17:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.43:
	* trigger.cpp 1.21:
	* trigger.h 1.23:
		Added the triggers added in SWGB.

2006-12-07	David
	* scen.cpp 1.58:
		Fixed reading of SWGB scenarios. (They changed the format but 
		not the version identifier?!)

	* MAKEFILE 1.21:
	* aokts.cpp 1.53:
	* editors.cpp 1.43:
	* settings.cpp 1.14:
		Updates for two builds (AOK and SWGB).

2006-11-28	David

	* readme.txt 1.21:
	* resource.h 1.44:

		possible access violations.

2006-11-21	David
	* trigedit.cpp 1.42:
		Removed the full trigger tree reset on PSN_KILLACTIVE. This will 
		definitely speed up tab switching, but it might cause some weird 
		saving errors. I hope not.

	* trigger.cpp 1.20:
		Effect::snd_len was never copied (resulting in a pretty much 
		random value) when pasting an effect. Blech.


2006-11-20	David
	* aokts.cpp 1.50:
		Large icon was not set. (bug 105)

	* aokts.cpp 1.51:
	* mapview.cpp 1.18:

		the screen when painting. This keeps the map painting process 
		from having to be redone on every draw operation. (bug 104)

	* unitedit.cpp 1.34:
		Oops, missed an unhighlight in the unit editor.

	* AOKTS.rc 1.55:
	* editors.cpp 1.41:
	* editors.h 1.12:
	* resource.h 1.42:
	* scen.cpp 1.57:
	* scen.h 1.29:
	* scen_const.h 1.16:
		Map copy! (A few other code cleanups as I saw them, but nothing 
		that should have any effect.)

	* zlibfile.h 1.2:
		Added a newline at end. How interesting.

	* scx_format.txt 1.16:
		Added normal values of the "whocares" bitmap unknown value.

	* mapview.cpp 1.16:
	* mapview.h 1.6:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.33:
		Changed mapview to support multiple highlighted points. I will 
		use this for map copying.

	* datatypes.h 1.13:
		Moved SVector functions inside the class definition because the 
		MSVC IDE likes it that way.

2006-11-12	David
	* editors.cpp 1.40:
		Player's AI mode was read from the allied victory checkbox 
		instead of the actual AI mode one. Oops. (103)

	* mapview.cpp 1.15:
	* mapview.h 1.5:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.32:
		Map didn't update when moving a unit (bug 99)

	* scen.cpp 1.56:
		Resetting a scenario did not reset the terrain data. (bug 102)

2006-11-05	David
	* utilunit.cpp 1.16:
	* utilunit.h 1.10:
		Added UnitList_InsertItem() and fixed a memory leak and a 
		possible crash in UnitList_Fille().

	* editors.cpp 1.39:
		Added some crash protection to disables editor. (bug 98)

	* unitedit.cpp 1.31:
		Gave the unit editing code a much-needed cleanup and properly re-
		ordered the unit list on constant change (bug 13).

2006-11-04	David
	* aokts.ini 1.17:
	* mapview.cpp 1.14:
	* settings.cpp 1.12:
	* settings.h 1.11:
		Added a setting in aokts.ini to change the minimap zoom. (bug 96)
		

	* mapview.cpp 1.13:
		Switched from PatBlt() to FillRect(). Stupid me...

	* AOKTS.rc 1.54:
	* resource.h 1.41:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.41:
	* utilui.cpp 1.13:
	* utilui.h 1.18:
		Added a menu item and accelerator for renaming and subclassed 
		the trigger tree-view's edit controls to accept enter and esc 
		keypresses. (bug 97)

2006-10-25	David
	* AOKTS.rc 1.53:
		The trigger description edit control now accepts hard returns (
		bug 94).

2006-10-16	David
	* makefile.dep 1.19:
	* trigdata.cpp 1.6:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.39:
		Decided to merge trigdata.cpp stuff back into trigedit.cpp.

	* trigedit.cpp 1.40:
		Added some validity checks on c_trig before it is used, 
		hopefully this will make the editor much more robust. (bug 90)

2006-10-11	David
	* trigedit.cpp 1.38:
		Moving triggers via dragging caused the dragged trigger to save 
		one trigger too far down. (bug 92)

2006-10-10	David
	* MAKEFILE 1.20:
		Added "clean" target.

	* trigdata.cpp 1.5:
		Duplicating triggers for each player now only duplicates for 
		active players. (bug 91)

	* trigedit.cpp 1.35:

		Minor data corruption bug.

2006-04-14	Administrator

		probably won't make any mistakes like I do. (bug 76)

	* ecedit.cpp 1.38:
		Cleaned up Effect's command-handling procedure and added some EC 
		editor/mapview interaction.

	* mapview.cpp 1.11:

	* trigger.cpp 1.4:
	* trigger.h 1.7:
		First of all, new extensible system for Effect/Condition editing started.
		Second, realized Effect copy/paste was very buggy because of the SString member, and wrote Effect::Effect(char *data, int size), Effect::tobuffer(), and Effect::size() to fix it.

		updated.

	* utilui.cpp 1.2:
	* utilui.h 1.2:
	* utilunit.cpp 1.6:
	* utilunit.h 1.4:
		Lots of code cleanups, and comments in trigedit.cpp. Nothing 
		that should actually effect the user interface.

	* AOKTS.rc 1.12:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.12:
		Added delete button functionality.
		Removed IDC_T_DEL and IDC_T_DUPLICATE.
		Fixed version in about box.

2005-06-23	David
	* trigedit.cpp 1.10:

		Pasting a trigger now selects it.

2005-06-22	David
	* unitedit.cpp 1.10:
		Bugfix: The delete button on IDD_UNITS was always disabled.
		Newly created units now receive the type constant currently selected in the listbox.

	* unitedit.cpp 1.11:
		Notice on the delete bug. Will fix later.

	* aokts.cpp 1.9:
		Bugfix: Re-added call to scen.reset() in FileOpen(), I don't 
		know why I took it out in the first place. Taking it out caused 
		strange errors when loading a new scenario on top of an old one.

	* scen.h 1.6:
		Bugfix: Gave Scenario::msg 356 bytes, which is _MAX_FILE plus 
		100 bytes for the error message. That should be enough.

	* utilunit.h 1.3:
		A clarification on the behavior of UnitList_Fill().

	* AOKTS.rc 1.11:
		A little bit of cleaning up of IDD_COND. Needs a lot more, 
		though.

	* ecedit.cpp 1.6:
		Bugfix: IDC_C_RESEARCH wasn't filled with technologies list.

	* editors.cpp 1.8:
	* editors.h 1.5:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.9:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.12:
		Removed Load*() and Save*() prototypes from editors.h, and thus moved the functions up a bit in editors.cpp, unitedit.cpp, and trigedit.cpp.
		Bugfix: If LoadUnit() cannot find the requested unit to load, it will tell the user, then quit.

	* scen.cpp 1.9:
		Some readability fixes and prevention of one deadlock.

	* scen.cpp 1.10:
		Bugfix: "Unrecognzied". Thanks, oliver. :-P

	* makefile.dep 1.9:
		Another dependency mistake.

	* editors.cpp 1.7:
		Added numerical sizes to the built-in map size strings.
		LoadMap() now sees if selected size is one of the built-ins.

	* datatypes.h 1.4:
		Fixed a compiler warning.

2005-06-21	David
	* datatypes.h 1.3:

	* resource.h 1.7:
	* scen.cpp 1.8:
	* scen.h 1.5:
	* scx_format.txt 1.3:
		Discovered that a float I though was constant isn't.

	* aokts.cpp 1.8:
		Bugfix: A possible crash when loading a scenario while another 
		was open to the trigger editor.

	* ecedit.cpp 1.5:
		Updated to use the unit selector window.
		
		Switched to a macro for filling combo boxes (much prettier code).

	* MAKEFILE 1.7:
		Fixed an inconsistency with program database for debugging.

	* AOKTS.rc 1.8:
	* resource.h 1.6:
	* utilunit.cpp 1.4:
		Improved unit selector, but still untested in AOK.

	* utilunit.cpp 1.5:
		Added sorting for IDD_UNITSEL. (Only SORT_ID functions for now, 
		though.)

	* aokts.ini 1.7:
	* readme.txt 1.6:
		Updated for release.

	* datatypes.h 1.2:
		A comment that has been waiting to be committed for a while.

	* src_notes.txt 1.2:
		Updated some stuff from pre-cvs times.

	* readme.txt 1.5:

	* scen_const.cpp 1.3:
	* scen_const.h 1.4:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.7:
	* trigger.h 1.5:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.9:
	* utilunit.cpp 1.3:
		First, I moved the technology names back into an array. (I'm 
		going to do the same with units later.) Second, I changed all 
		calls of GetWindowLong() that were getting GWL_HINSTANCE to 
		calls to GetModuleHandle(NULL), as it is much simpler.

	* AOK Trigger Studio.dsp 1.6:
	* AOK Trigger Studio.ncb 1.5:
	* AOKTS.rc 1.6:
	* ecedit.cpp 1.3:
	* makefile.dep 1.8:
	* resource.h 1.5:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.8:
	* utilunit.cpp 1.2:
	* utilunit.h 1.2:

		Fixed an error-message overflow bug.

2005-04-24	David
	* AOK Trigger Studio.dsp 1.5:
		Changed some options around, added the new files... this should 
		have been done earlier.

	* scen.cpp 1.7:
		A very minor change to make debugging easier.

	* trigger.h 1.3:
		Added in-order lists of Effects & Conditions, among other

2005-04-23	David
	* AOKTS.rc 1.5:
	* MAKEFILE 1.6:
	* makefile.dep 1.7:
	* resource.h 1.4:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.7:
	* utilunit.cpp 1.1:
	* utilunit.h 1.1:
		Started on IDD_UNITSEL, the floating units selector window I've been planning on for a while.
		Also moved some units functions from unitedit.cpp to utilunit.cpp in planning for some shared use.

	* aokts.cpp 1.7:
		Fixed trigger-deletion-save crash bug.

	* editors.cpp 1.3:
	* editors.h 1.4:
		Minor code change: Players_ManageAI() was in the header and it 
		shouldn't have been.

	* ecedit.cpp 1.2:
	* trigger.h 1.2:
		Added support for multiple selected units in an effect.

2005-04-22	David
	* MAKEFILE 1.5:
	* aokts.cpp 1.6:
	* aokts.ini 1.4:
	* makefile.dep 1.6:
	* settings.cpp 1.1:
	* settings.h 1.2:
		Split off class Setts code into settings.cpp.
		Also finally finished the Recent file code, may have a few bugs, but at least it works.

	* unitedit.cpp 1.6:
		Greatly sped up UnitList_Fill() after I noticed a ~5 second 
		delay on scenarios with large numbers of units.

2005-04-20	David
	* makefile.dep 1.5:
		Another small dependency problem. (I really need to get 
		something to generate these for me...)

	* settings.h 1.1:
		Yes, this should have been here before.

	* aokts.cpp 1.5:
	* aokts.ini 1.3:
	* scen.cpp 1.6:
	* utilio.h 1.2:
		Mostly added a lot more Recent File code, all I have left should be saving the new recent files to the INI.
		I also cleaned up FileOpen() a bit, reorganizing and making the call to scen.reset() unnecessary. (This, in turn, inspired a change in READT() to erase SStrings if len = 0.)

2005-04-19	David
	* makefile.dep 1.4:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.6:

	* makefile.dep 1.3:
	* resource.h 1.3:
	* trigedit.cpp 1.5:
	* unitedit.cpp 1.5:
		First, I finally got this a little more modularized: I moved the PropSheetData stuff to editors.h, made settings.h for the ever-growing struct Setts, and distributed some other minor stuff elsewhere. Then I deleted aokts.h. Good riddance.
		Second, I set up a UI interface for Recent files, but I haven't finished by any means and haven't even started on loading the files from the INI (although that shouldn't be too hard).

2005-04-18	David
	* scen_const.h 1.3:
		Removed some old stuff, added multi-include protection. (I can't 
		believe I forgot it before...)

2005-04-17	David
	* unitedit.cpp 1.3:
		Added support for new unit groups in struct Setts. (Woohoo!)

	* readme.txt 1.3:
		Updated for bugfixes.

	* trigedit.cpp 1.3:
		Standardized TVN_GETDISPINFO response.
		Removed call to TrigTree_Reset() on PSN_KILLACTIVE to speed up page switching. (It is still called on PSN_SETACTIVE anyway.)

	* makefile.dep 1.2:
		Fixed a few dependencies, cleaned up a bit.

	* unitedit.cpp 1.4:
		Bufgix: Problem when unit selected with constant not on current 
		group list. Now automatically switches to "All" if that occurs.

	* scen.cpp 1.4:
		Bugfix: Disables didn't properly clear on scenario reset.

	* scen.cpp 1.5:
		Bugfix: 0-length unit list for a player returned an error.

	* trigedit.cpp 1.4:
		Bugfix: Condition/Effect treeview items didn't update when 
		editor closed.

	* aokts.cpp 1.3:
	* aokts.h 1.2:
		Added unit group code to struct Setts.

	* scen_const.cpp 1.2:
	* scen_const.h 1.2:
		Added a units_nocrash, a list of all non-crashing units. (Some 
		of these, such as PMANG, may still crash on occasion.)

	* aokts.ini 1.2:
		Added some unit groups I made a while ago to test new unit group 
		fuction. (It works!)

2005-04-16	David
	* AOK Trigger Studio.ncb 1.4:
	* AOK Trigger Studio.opt 1.4:
		Done for the day.

	* editors.h 1.2:
		Removed miscellaneous unit function prototypes.

	* unitedit.cpp 1.2:
		Fixed a bug with adding units.
		Added code to enable/disable IDC_U_DEL depending on selection state.
		Adding a unit now selects the created unit.

	* AOK Trigger Studio.opt 1.5:
		Decided not to keep this in CVS. If I ckeckout my files 
		somewhere else, chances are I won't care about workspace options 
		anyway.

2005-04-14	David
	* scen.cpp 1.2:
	* scen.h 1.2:
		Got rid of some old commented stuff. CVS will take care of that 
		now. :-)

	* old_versions.txt 1.2:
		Deleted and moved content to webpage.

	* scen.cpp 1.3:
	* scen.h 1.3:
		Fixed the PlayerData3 inital view bug.
		Also combined RMSG and SMSGS defines, since they were almost always used together.

		Clarified "See Below" about PlayerData3 problem.

	* AOK Trigger Studio.dsp 1.3:
	* AOK Trigger Studio.ncb 1.3:

--Old Changelog--
Note: The dates are in DD/MM/YY; I prefer it that way. Sorry if it confuses anyone.

10/09/04
scen.h: Moved Scenario::export_ai() into player class.
scen.cpp: Cleaned up Player::export_ai() and Scenario::export_bmp().
scen.h: Switched to windows standard bitmap structs. Sad, but basically necessary.
scen.h: Wrapped bitmap in the AOKBMP struct. Should be a lot more organized this way.
editors.cpp: Added UpdateTrigPtrs(), one step closer to changing TVITEM::lParam to a pointer.
editors.cpp: Began changing TVITEM::lParam to be a pointer.
scen.h: Effect and Condition are now subclasses of ECBase.
editors.cpp: Changed condition/effect nodes to display type.

11/09/04
editors.cpp: Continued the TVITEM::lParam change.
Created trigedit.h and trigedit.cpp and moved all applicable code there. The trigger section was really getting way too hefty for editors.cpp.
Created utilui.h and utilui.cpp for use by both trigedit.cpp and editors.cpp.

12/09/04
trigedit.cpp: Finished the TVITEM::lParam change.
trigedit.cpp: Fixed a bug in which a duplicated trigger pointed to the source trigger.

13/09/04
Switched back to using the trigger list order after I relized the difficulty with activate/deactivate trigger effects.
scen.h: Added Trigger::write(), which greatly cleans up the trigger list writing in write_data().

15/09/04
scen.h: Added Scenario::remove_trigger(), which takes care of the list order mess.
sstring.h: Fixed a bug in the bounds-checking of SVector::at().
trigedit.cpp: Fixed a bug with deleting triggers.

16/09/04
editors.cpp: Constant number now updates when new unit is selected on unit tab.

18/04/04
scen.cpp: Changed trigger loading so that effect/condition order is handled one at a time. (Thus eliminating any limit.)
scen.h: Added Map::read() and Map::write().
scen.cpp: Map now reads square (as it's supposed to) instead of filling in the array regardless of order.

20/09/04
aokts.rc: Removed CBS_SORT on some combo boxes in IDD_EFFECT and IDD_COND that souldn't have had it.
aokts.rc: Added CBS_SORT to the effect/condition player selection since GAIA is treated as player 0.
scen.h: Added Player::age. (It is loaded from scenario but not editable.)
scen.cpp: Fixed player 1's initial camera pos. (Stupid ES.)
scen.cpp: Now using CHECKSECT() for greater stability. (At least in debug mode.)

21/09/04
scen.cpp: Added a few handler functions for opening/saving.
Deflation/Inflation is now handled by deflate_file() and inflate_file() in zlibfile.h.

24/09/04
editors.cpp: AI Export box now automatically selects AOK directory.

25/09/04
Moved MakeFilebox() to utilui.h, since aokts.cpp doesn't need it anymore.
editors.cpp: Bitmap export box now automatically selects AOK directory.
Scenario class now does not store path, Setts does.
scen.cpp: Temporary output file is now closed before read_data() is called in open().
Version 0.2.6 Released.

10/11/04
Started working again! Fun!
scen.cpp: Scenario::write_data() now writes t_order how it's supposed to. (I can't believe someone didn't tell me about this!)
trigedit.cpp: IDD_EFFECT's IDC_E_UIDS now accepts 1 (and only 1) UID.
scen.cpp: Condition::Condition() now only memsets the members it's supposed to.

14/11/04
aokts.cpp: Finally got TranslateAccelerator() to work right! Ctrl+O and Ctrl+S now work!
trigedit.h & trigedit.cpp: Split off control enabling/disabling into EffectControls() and ConditionControls().
trigedit.cpp: Changing IDC_E_TYPE and IDC_C_TYPE calls EffectControls() and ConditionControls(), respectively.
trigedit.cpp: Fixed the IDC_E_TPLAY noshow bug for Send Tribute.

16/11/04
Split scenario constants from scen.h and scen.cpp into scen_const.h and scen_const.cpp. Much better this way.

19/11/04
I'm free! I'm free! The play's over! (It was fun, though.)
scen.cpp: Fixed a never-ocurring memory leak in Scenario::open().

25/11/04
Happy thanksgiving!
Continued adding comments to code.
Removed scen_const.h (hehe) and put english arrays in respective structs.

26/11/04
I should be doing homework today...
